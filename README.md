## The <b>Funnifier</b>
Are you mad at your previous company for not paying you <b>nearly</b> enough? Do you want to take part in a bit of foolery? A fraction of goofery, a real piece of tomfoolery. Do some silly things? Commit mischevious acts? Well, then this repo is for you.

Have you heard of the funny <b>greek question mark?</b> The one that looks <b>IDENTICAL</b> to a semicolon, but cannot be parsed properly by any interpreter/compiler? Well imagine a program, that can replace any semicolon in a given file with a greek question mark (that would probably cause some issues)!

## How to use:

```
funnifier <file_to_funnify> [optional --minify]
```

After passing the ```--minify``` option the given file will be additionaly minified (for extra trolling)
